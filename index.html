                    <div>He was the Great Jehovah of the Old Testament, the Messiah of the New. Under the direction of His Father, 
                        He was the creator of the earth. “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made” . 
                        Though sinless, He was baptized to fulfill all righteousness. He “went about doing good” (Acts 10:38), yet was despised for it. 
                        His gospel was a message of peace and goodwill. He entreated all to follow His example. He walked the roads of Palestine, 
                        healing the sick, causing the blind to see, and raising the dead. He taught the truths of eternity, the reality of our premortal 
                        existence, the purpose of our life on earth, and the potential for the sons and daughters of God in the life to come.

                    <div>He instituted the sacrament as a reminder of His great atoning sacrifice. He was arrested and condemned on spurious charges, 
                        convicted to satisfy a mob, and sentenced to die on Calvary's cross. He gave His life to atone for the sins of all mankind. 
                        His was a great vicarious gift in behalf of all who would ever live upon the earth.

                        He visited among those He had loved in life. He also ministered among His “other sheep” in ancient America. 
                        In the modern world, He and His Father appeared to the boy Joseph Smith, ushering in the long-promised “dispensation of the fulness of times.”
